<h1>Hello! :)</h1>
<p>I'm Oaafy, also known as CSKL, Kel, Mckel or whatever else people feel like calling me (lol)</p>
<p>I am 17 years old and from the holy land of France, I live in the UK and I am part Canadian! I enjoy coding, making music, playing VR/other random games & hanging out with my awesome partner <a href="https://64will64.com/">will! â™¡</a></p>
<p>I'm sort of a genderless idiot, I'm technically genderfluid but not by choice, it's a long story, I am more female than male but I am also technically labeled as a trans man... medical stuff huh?</p>
<p>I like watching Bringus, I also like collecting old Thinkpad's, CRT's, Cameras, Music Equipment & VR Headsets. I also like airplanes, spesifically the insides of them, dunno why lol.</p>
<p>The ins & outs of this website is a total hellscape (please send help), I do enjoy working on it sometimes though</p>
<p>Amyway thanks for reading, check out more shit <a href="index.html">here!</a></p>
